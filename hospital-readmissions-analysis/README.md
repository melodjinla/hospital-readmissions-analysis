# Hospital Readmissions Analysis

Analyzed 25,000 hospital stays to explore factors tied to patient readmissions.

## Key Insights
- Patients who were readmitted stayed longer in the hospital*on average.
- Most common diagnoses among readmitted patients: Circulatory, Respiratory, Digestive.
- Patients who had recent medication changes** were slightly more likely to be readmitted.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook for EDA

## Business Recommendations
- Provide extra follow-up for patients with circulatory or respiratory conditions.
- Consider closer monitoring for those with recent medication changes to reduce readmissions.
